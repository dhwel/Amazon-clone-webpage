# Amazon-clone-webpage
I have successfully built a Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS as part of a project. This project helped me to improve my web development skills and learn new techniques. I used HTML to create the content and CSS to design the layout, colors, and fonts. I also used flexbox and font awesome site to enhance the website.
